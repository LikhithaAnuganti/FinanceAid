## Business Model
Our business model revolves around a **holistic approach to students’ financial needs**. The core of our operations lies in the interaction between students and multiple specialized teams within **FINAID**.

1. **Student Interaction:** Students initiate the process by providing their essential details through our user-friendly website.  
2. **Screening Team (SCT):** The Screening Team verifies these leads through manual calls, ensuring the accuracy and authenticity of the information.  
3. **Advising Team (ADT):** Once verified, leads are transferred to our dedicated Advising Team, where experienced advisors assist students on a first-come-first-serve basis.  
4. **Bank Onboarding Team (BOT):** The Bank Onboarding Team collaborates with banks to secure vital information on loan offerings. Partner banks, willing to cooperate, become part of the **FINAID** database.  
5. **Loan Matching:** Advisors in **ADT** understand students’ requirements and leverage the loan offerings database to facilitate meetings between the students and the matching banks’ point of contact (**BPOC**).  

This comprehensive model ensures that students receive **personalized guidance** while accessing a diverse range of financial options.

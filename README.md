# FinanceAid
FINAID is a visionary loan advising firm committed to empowering students by facilitating
their access to education loans and providing unbiased advice on loan options. As
international students ourselves, we realize the necessity of such an entity in the market. In an
era where education is paramount to individual growth and success, FINAID plays a pivotal
role in the market as it operates without any inherent financial incentives from specific loan
providers. This unique position allows us to offer students impartial guidance on education
loans, ensuring their best interests are at the forefront. By guiding students towards affordable
financial solutions, we contribute to a brighter future for the next generation. Our mission is
to bridge the gap between aspiring students and educational finance, making quality
education accessible to all.
Our business model revolves around a holistic approach to students’ financial needs. The
core of our operations lies in the interaction between students and multiple specialized teams
within FINAID. Students initiate the process by providing their essential details through our
user-friendly website. Our diligent Screening Team (SCT) verifies these leads through
manual calls, ensuring the accuracy and authenticity of the information. Once verified, these
leads are transferred to our dedicated Advising Team (ADT), where experienced advisors
assist students on a first-come-first-serve basis. Simultaneously, our Bank Onboarding Team
(BOT) collaborates with banks, securing vital information on loan offerings. Partner banks,
willing to cooperate, become part of the FINAID database. Advisors in ADT understand
students’ requirements and leverage the loan offerings database to facilitate meetings
between the students and the matching banks’ point of contact (BPOC). This comprehensive
model ensures that students receive personalized guidance while accessing a diverse range of
financial options.
To facilitate the seamless operation of our business model, we propose the development of a
robust and efficient database system. The database will be designed to capture and manage
student information, lead status, advisor availability, and bank partner details. It will store
essential data points such as student names, contact information, university affiliations,
course fees, and loan status. The Lead Generation System will act as the initial point of entry,
collecting and organizing student data. The Screening System will ensure data accuracy by
verifying leads manually. The Advisors System will rely on the database to allocate resources
efficiently based on advisor availability. Lastly, the Bank Management System will be used
to cross-reference user preferences with partner bank offerings, providing students with
tailored financial options. This database will be the backbone of our operations, enabling us
to deliver personalized and reliable services to students while fostering fruitful collaborations
with partner banks.
